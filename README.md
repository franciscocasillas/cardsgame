# Lessons learned
1. One of the primary goals of this project was to adhere to clean code principles. Applying these principles to the Javascript code significantly improved its readability. While there is room for imprvemenet in function and variable naming, the code is much more organized. However, upon reviewing my HTML code, I realized that similar principles to enhance its readability, too. Planning the HTML structure in advance can expedite the process of locating elements and improve the overall code quality.
